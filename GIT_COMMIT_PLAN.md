```

### 8. Directory Structure
```bash
git add src/ data/ notebooks/ models/ visualizations/ tests/
git commit -m "Add organized project directory structure

- Create clean folder hierarchy for better organization
- Separate source code, data, notebooks, and outputs
- Add placeholder directories for future expansion
- Follow Python project best practices"
```

### 9. Final Repository Setup
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Complete data science portfolio setup

- All projects refactored with improved code quality
- Added comprehensive documentation and type hints

- Added modular class-based architecture
- Included extensive visualizations and analysis
- Ready for GitHub publication and portfolio showcase"
```

## Alternative Single Commit Approach
If you prefer a single comprehensive commit:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Complete data science portfolio with 5 ML projects

Projects included:
- Fake News Detection: NLP classification with PassiveAggressiveClassifier
- Netflix Analysis: Content popularity prediction with RF and LR
- Sales Dashboard: Interactive web app with Dash and Plotly
- House Price Prediction: Regression analysis with multiple algorithms
- Twitter Sentiment Analysis: NLP sentiment classification

Improvements made:
- Refactored all code into modular class-based architecture
- Added comprehensive documentation and type hints
- Implemented proper error handling and validation
- Created extensive visualizations and analysis
- Added proper project structure and documentation
- Included requirements.txt and comprehensive README

## Post-Commit Actions

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# After creating repository on GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/data-science-portfolio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Add Repository Topics/Tags
On GitHub, add these topics to improve discoverability:
- `machine-learning`
- `data-science`
- `python`
- `nlp`
- `sentiment-analysis`
- `fake-news-detection`
- `netflix-analysis`
- `house-price-prediction`
- `sales-dashboard`
- `portfolio`

### 3. Create Release
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release of data science portfolio"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Summary
This commit plan ensures:
- ✅ Clean, organized project structure
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Improved code quality and architecture
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation
- ✅ Extensive visualizations and analysis
- ✅ Ready for GitHub publication
- ✅ Professional portfolio presentation
